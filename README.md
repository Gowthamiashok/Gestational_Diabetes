IDENTIFICATION AND PREDICTION OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES DURING PREGNANCY USING NEURAL NETWORK MODELS

Abstract

The GDM (gestational diabetes mellitus) is accompanied by the severe health issues of both the mother and the fetus during pregnancy which is a challenging condition. 
The timely detection and prediction of GDM in the early stages are vitally important for the implementation of necessary measures and the reduction of possible complications in 
the future. The present article focuses on the efficacy of the neural network models namely the feedforward neural networks (FNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent 
neural networks (RNN), and the combination of CNN and RNN (CNN-RNN) for the purpose of GDM prediction. Making the use of a complete dataset that has demography, clinical and lifestyle 
variables, our analytics reveal the characteristics of each model. We emphasize our approach on the basis of the significant degree of our experimentation and the assessment of the dataset 
composed of the data of pregnant women. As a result, we provide an example of the neural network models and prediction of GDM. Evaluation indices especially Accuracy, Sensitivity, and 
Specificity, highlight the effectiveness of the approach to precisely forecast GDM risk. According to our results, neural network models have huge potentials as important diagnostic 
instruments in the GDM detection in clinical settings. These tools are paving the way for preventive strategies and optimal results by improving the maternal and fetal outcomes
